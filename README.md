## Aknowledgements
Thank you to Dr Simon M. Reader for giving me the opportunity to learn more about the scientific process at his lab over the summer. Thank you to Alexandra Berger for guiding me throughout the my time in the lab, answering my questions, and doing their best to be helpful. I would also like to thank Megan Cyr and Arabella Van der Wee for answering my questions and keeping me company over the summer!

## Methods
All the statistical tests were written in R and run Alexandra Berger except for t-tests for all coverage levels on the latency to the first feeder, done by me.
Alexandra's R code for Part 2 can be found in this GitHub repository by the name [ch2-task-complexity-demo-training-Alex-Berger.Rmd](Population-differences-in-problem-solving-appendix/ch2-task-complexity-demo-training-Alex-Berger.Rmd) The file paths have been modified to work on my computer.

Alex's edited code cann be found at [ch2-task-complexity-demo training-Carolyn-Edit.Rmd](Population-differences-in-problem-solving-appendix/ch2-task-complexity-demo training-Carolyn-Edit.Rmd). This includes the t-tests that I did for training and the increasing coverage level parts of the report.

## Data
Videos of the trials are hosted on SharePoint. For access, please email alexandra.berger@mail.mcgill.ca

The naming convention is as follows: Trial number - tank numbers

Raw and summarized data can be found in the file called [pilot_tc_clean.xlsx](Population-differences-in-problem-solving-appendix/pilot_tc_clean.xlsx)
