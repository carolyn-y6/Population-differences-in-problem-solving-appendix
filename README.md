## Aknowledgements
Thank you to Dr Simon M. Reader for giving me the opportunity to learn more about the scientific process at his lab over the summer. Thank you to Alexandra Berger for guiding me throughout the my time in the lab, answering my questions, and doing their best to be helpful. I would also like to thank Megan Cyr and Arabella Van der Wee for answering my questions and keeping me company over the summer!

## Detailed Methods
All the statistical tests were written in R and run Alexandra Berger except for t-tests for all coverage levels on the latency to the first feeder, done by me.
Alexandra's R code for Part 2 can be found in this GitHub repository by the name 'ch2 task complexity demo training.Rmd.' The file paths have been modified to work on my computer.
Unfortunetly the R code I used to do my t-tests was left on my old computer which I will gain acccess to in September.

## Data
